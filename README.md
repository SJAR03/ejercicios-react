# Exercises 1, 2, and 3: PropTypes and useState

**Exercise Explanation and Requirements:**

In this first React programming challenge, we will put into practice what we have learned so far by creating two components: Component A and Component B.

#### Component A

Component A represents a Contact and has the following features:

- **Name**: A string representing the contact's name.
- **Last Name**: A string representing the contact's last name.
- **Email**: A string representing the contact's email.
- **Connected**: A boolean indicating whether the contact is connected or not.

#### Component B

On the other hand, we have Component B, which receives a contact as a prop and can toggle its connected state between connected and disconnected.

- If the contact is connected, it should display: "Contact Online".
- If the contact is disconnected, it should display: "Contact Unavailable".

#### Rendering Components in the Solution

- Component A should be rendered inside the `App.js` component of the project.
- Component B should be rendered from Component A and receive props correctly.

Remember to use PropTypes properly to validate the types of props received by the components.
