## Exercises 1, 2, and 3: PropTypes and useState

**Exercise Explanation and Requirements:**

In this first React programming challenge, we will put into practice what we have learned so far by creating two components: Component A and Component B.

#### Component A

Component A represents a Contact and has the following features:

- **Name**: A string representing the contact's name.
- **Last Name**: A string representing the contact's last name.
- **Email**: A string representing the contact's email.
- **Connected**: A boolean indicating whether the contact is connected or not.

#### Component B

On the other hand, we have Component B, which receives a contact as a prop and can toggle its connected state between connected and disconnected.

- If the contact is connected, it should display: "Contact Online".
- If the contact is disconnected, it should display: "Contact Unavailable".

#### Rendering Components in the Solution

- Component A should be rendered inside the `App.js` component of the project.
- Component B should be rendered from Component A and receive props correctly.

Remember to use PropTypes properly to validate the types of props received by the components.

## Exercises 4, 5, and 6: Converting Class Component to Functional Component

**Exercise Explanation and Requirements:**

Given the following class component that includes several lifecycle methods, we need to convert it into a functional component that performs the same functionality.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import '../../styles/clock.scss';

class Clock extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // Component's private state
    this.state = {
      // Generate initial date as component's state
      date: new Date(),
      age: 0,
      name: 'Martin',
      lastName: 'San Jose',
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(() => this.tick(), 1000);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerID);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Current Time: {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}</h2>
        <h3>
          {this.state.name} {this.state.lastName}
        </h3>
        <h1>Age: {this.state.age}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }

  tick() {
    this.setState((prevState) => {
      let age = prevState.age + 1;
      return {
        ...prevState,
        date: new Date(),
        age,
      };
    });
  }
}

export default Clock;
```

## Exercises 7, 8, and 9: Contact List in React JS

**Exercise Description and Requirements:**

In this React JS exercise, you are asked to create a contact list with the following functionalities:

##### Display Contact

The list should display existing contacts, including their information such as name, last name, email, and connection status.

##### Create Contact

You should implement the functionality to add new contacts to the list. Each contact should have a name, last name, email, and initial connection status.

##### Delete Contact

There should be an option to delete existing contacts from the list. When a contact is deleted, it should disappear from the view.

##### Change Contact Status

Each contact should have a connection status that can be changed between "Connected" and "Disconnected". There should be a way to change this status for each contact individually.

## Exercises 10, 11, and 12: Changing Color on Mouse Events

**Exercise Description and Requirements:**

In this exercise, you will create a component that contains an element, such as a rectangle or a square.

The dimensions of the element should be 255px width and 255px height, and its initial color should be black.

**Inside the component, you will implement several mouse event handlers that will change the color of the element:**

- A method that changes the color of the component to a random RGB value (between 0 and 255) when the mouse enters the container.
- A method that stops the color change completely when the mouse leaves the component.
- Finally, a method that stops the color change when the component is double-clicked.

## Exercises 13, 14, and 15: Task List and Form using Formik and Yup libraries

**Exercise Description and Requirements:**

Starting from the final project, you must create a form to create tasks. To do this you will use:

- **Formik for the form.**
- **Yup for the validations.**

## Upcoming Exercises (ðŸš€)

The fun doesn't end here! There are still many more exercises on the way that I hope to solve as I continue progressing in the course.
