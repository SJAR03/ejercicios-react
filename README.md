## Exercises 10, 11, and 12: Changing Color on Mouse Events

**Exercise Description and Requirements:**

In this exercise, you will create a component that contains an element, such as a rectangle or a square.

The dimensions of the element should be 255px width and 255px height, and its initial color should be black.

**Inside the component, you will implement several mouse event handlers that will change the color of the element:**

- A method that changes the color of the component to a random RGB value (between 0 and 255) when the mouse enters the container.
- A method that stops the color change completely when the mouse leaves the component.
- Finally, a method that stops the color change when the component is double-clicked.
